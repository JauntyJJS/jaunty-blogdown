  abstract={A comprehensive and standardized system to report lipid structures analyzed by MS is essential for the communication and storage of lipidomics data. Herein, an update on both the LIPID MAPS classification system and shorthand notation of lipid structures is presented for lipid categories Fatty Acyls (FA), Glycerolipids (GL), Glycerophospholipids (GP), Sphingolipids (SP), and Sterols (ST). With its major changes, i.e., annotation of ring double bond equivalents and number of oxygens, the updated shorthand notation facilitates reporting of newly delineated oxygenated lipid species as well. For standardized reporting in lipidomics, the hierarchical architecture of shorthand notation reflects the diverse structural resolution powers provided by mass spectrometric assays. Moreover, shorthand notation is expanded beyond mammalian phyla to lipids from plant and yeast phyla. Finally, annotation of atoms is included for the use of stable isotope-labeled compounds in metabolic labeling experiments or as internal standards. This update on lipid classification, nomenclature, and shorthand annotation for lipid mass spectra is considered a standard for lipid data presentation.}

  abstract={Triglyceride (TG) is a class of neutral lipids, which functions as an energy storage depot and is important for cellular growth, metabolism, and function. The composition and content of TG molecular species are crucial factors for nutritional aspects in food chemistry and are directly associated with several diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, stroke, etc. As a result of the complexities of aliphatic moieties and their different connections/locations to the glycerol backbone in TG molecules, accurate identification of individual TG molecular species and quantitative assessment of TG composition and content are particularly challenging, even at the current stage of lipidomics development. Herein, methods developed for analysis of TG species, such as liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry with a variety of columns and different mass spectrometric techniques, shotgun lipidomics approaches, and ion-mobility-based analysis, are reviewed. Moreover, the potential limitations of the methods are discussed. It is our sincere hope that the overviews and discussions can provide some insights for researchers to select an appropriate approach for TG analysis and can serve as the basis for those who would like to establish a methodology for TG analysis or develop a new method when novel tools become available. Biologically accurate analysis of TG species with an enabling method should lead us toward improving the nutritional quality, revealing the effects of TG on diseases, and uncovering the underlying biochemical mechanisms related to these diseases.}

  abstract={We introduce Goslin, a polyglot grammar for common lipid shorthand nomenclatures based on the LIPID MAPS nomenclature and the shorthand nomenclature established by Liebisch and coauthors and used by LipidHome and SwissLipids. Goslin was designed to address the following pressing issues in the lipidomics field: (1) to simplify the implementation of lipid name handling for developers of mass spectrometry-based lipidomics tools, (2) to offer a tool that unifies and normalizes the main existing lipid name dialects enabling a lipidomics analysis in a high-throughput fashion, and (3) to provide a consistent mapping from lipid shorthand names to lipid building blocks and structural properties. We provide implementations of Goslin in four major programming languages, namely, C++, Java, Python 3, and R to kick-start adoption and integration. Further, we set up a web service for users to work with Goslin directly. All implementations are available free of charge under a permissive open source license.}
