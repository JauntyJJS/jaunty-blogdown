## Short summary

There are many good resources on how to write good VBA code for Excel. However, during my experiences in working on VBA code in Excel, I realise some issues that makes it hard for such code to be open source, maintainable and contributor friendly. Nevertheless, I have managed to find alternative ways to tackle these problems. Hope that my suggestions may be useful for you.

## Introduction

Finding resources to learn and write VBA code in Excel is relatively simple. [Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/vba-tutorial.html) and [DevTut](https://devtut.github.io/excelvba/) are good places to start.

As I have gotten more familiar with the programming, I then started to look at best code practices for VBA code in Excel. Here are some web resources that was helpful to me:

-   Corporate Finance Institute's [Tips for Writing VBA in Excel](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/excel/study/tips-for-writing-vba-in-excel/)
-   Corporate Finance Institute's [Types of Errors in VBA for Excel](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/excel/study/types-of-errors-in-vba-for-excel/)
-   DevTut's chapter on [VBA Best Practices](https://devtut.github.io/excelvba/vba-best-practices.html)

With the knowledge gained, I have managed to created a workable Excel macro file called [MSTemplate_Creator](https://github.com/SLINGhub/MSTemplate_Creator) to help researchers create annotation sheets and templates from data exported directly from mass spectrometry software.

When it comes to making it open source, maintainable and contributor friendly, I was faced with several major setbacks which makes it hard to achieve these objectives. Resources to help meet these objectives, turn out to be [limited](https://www.excelforum.com/excel-programming-vba-macros/862789-good-coding-sustainable-projects-how-to.html#post2943927)

## The issues

The first one is that I have no idea how to export the VBA code in Excel as text files so that I can use version control via [git](https://git-scm.com/) and display them on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

The second one is that I have no clue how to create unit tests in VBA code in Excel. This makes the Excel macro file vulnerable to coding related bugs when changes are made to the VBA code. As the number of features increase and more codes are written, it starts to get hard to manage and maintain.

Another barrier is writing good code documentation for a function in Excel VBA code. Code documentation is important for other people to understand your code and build upon it. It is essential for making a software contributor friendly. The University of California, Berkeley Library's [blog post](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/how-to-write-good-documentation) provides a wealth of information on which tools can be used in programming languages like Python and R. 

For someone who knows how to create code documentation in R using [Roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html) and display them online using [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/), it will be very nice if I am able to do the same thing for Excel VBA. From this [issue post](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/issues/5017), I am indeed not the first who wanted this feature for VBA code in Excel.

## Version control

### Version control resources 

There are a few resources that has been developed to allow version control for Excel. Here are a few that I am aware of:

-   [SheetGit](http://spreadsheetsunl.github.io/sheetgit/)
-   [XLTools](https://xltools.net/)
-   [xltrail](https://www.xltrail.com/)

SheetGit is an add-in for Excel to track spreadsheets but it is unable to track VBA codes in Excel. On the other hand, while XLTools and xltrail does track VBA codes in Excel, it may not be suited for academia labs with limited financial resources to afford commercial software.

### Export VBA code implementation 

Thankfully, Steve Jansen has provided [VBA codes](https://gist.github.com/steve-jansen/7589478) to export VBA code in Excel to text file. I have modified the code such that it does not use the status bar `Application.StatusBar` and file system object `fso`. The modified `Export_Visual_Basic_Code` function can be found in the `Export_VBA` module

![export_vba_function](images/export_vba_function.png)

With regards to modifying the code to not use `Application.StatusBar`, I just replace it with a much simpler message box using `MsgBox`.

![message_box](images/message_box.png)

As for the use of `fso` to check if a folder exists and create a folder automatically, I replace it with a function `Get_Folder` from this stack overflow's [post](https://www.mrexcel.com/board/threads/browse-for-a-folder-in-vba.294728/) that creates a dialog box for users to select a folder to save the files. I have placed the `Get_Folder` function in the `Utilities` module

![get_folder_function](images/get_folder_function.png)

and in the `Export_Visual_Basic_Code`, I call it using `Utilities.Get_Folder`

![get_folder_function](images/call_get_folder_function.png)

### Export VBA code execution

With the implementation complete, I now run the `Export_Visual_Basic_Code` using the Run Sub button. Ensure that the cursor is located somewhere **inside** the macro function `Export_Visual_Basic_Code` before clicking this button, else the macro will not run.

![run_export_vba_function](images/run_export_vba_function.png)

The below GIF image shows how the process should look like.

![run_export_vba_animation](images/run_export_vba_animation.gif)

One downside of running this code is that files will be overwritten without giving a warning. Nevertheless, being able to export VBA code in Excel is good enough for me and hopefully for you as well.

With the VBA codes exported as text files, we can track it using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and display them on [GitHub](https://github.com/). For me, I use [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to run git and submit my codes to GitHub

Here is the [MSTemplate_Creator example](https://github.com/SLINGhub/MSTemplate_Creator/tree/main/src)

## Unit testing

Unit testing is crucial to ensure that the program remains functional when codes are extended or refactored. For Excel VBA in Excel, we can use [Rubberduck VBA](https://rubberduckvba.com/) to create a fully integrated test environment.

### Getting started with Rubberduck VBA

Here are the links to learn how to create unit tests using Rubberduck VBA

-   Benard's blog titled: [Learn Excel VBA Unit Testing](https://www.bernardvukas.com/testing/tutorial-excel-vba-unit-testing/)
-   Rubberduck VBA's blog titled: [How to unit test VBA code?](https://rubberduckvba.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/how-to-unit-test-vba-code/)
-   Rubberduck VBA's blog titled: [Code Insights with Rubberduck + Excel](https://rubberduckvba.wordpress.com/2019/01/05/code-insights-with-rubberduck-excel/)
-   Rubberduck VBA's Github Wiki page titled: [Unit Testing](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/wiki/Unit-Testing)

### Rubberduck VBA initialisation

I understand that using Rubberduck VBA may be complicated for some, hence, here is a step by step process. Ensure that the VBA code is **free from syntax error/bugs**.

Firstly, to check if Rubberduck VBA is successfully installed, open Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications from the Developer Tab and you should see the Rubberduck option.

![rubberduck_option](images/rubberduck_option.png)
To display the Rubberduck VBA toolbar, go to the toolbar options, "Add or Remove Buttons" and then click on "Customize".

![rubberduck_option](images/customize_buttons.png)

You will see the "Customize" box. Check the box beside "Rubberduck" and you will see the Rubberduck VBA toolbar being displayed. Click close.

![rubberduck_toolbar](images/rubberduck_toolbar.png)

However, it is possible that Rubberduck is not initialised and all the options may be masked.

![rubberduck_masked](images/rubberduck_masked.png)

To initialise it, click on "Pending" at the Rubberduck VBA toolbar

![rubberduck_pending](images/rubberduck_pending.png)

When it appears as ‚ÄúReady‚Äù, you can start the Rubberduck VBA tools like unit testing

![rubberduck_initialised](images/rubberduck_initialised)
### Function and corresponding unit test example

Ensure that the following Excel VBA reference list are checked, especially the

The function we are using to create the unit test is called `Is_EQC` and is created in the `Sample_Type_Identifier` module. 

## Excel Module Code
