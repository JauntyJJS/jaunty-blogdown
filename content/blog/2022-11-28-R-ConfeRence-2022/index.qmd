## Introduction

[R ConfeRence 2022](https://www.r-conference.com/home) is one of the biggest R event in Malaysia conducted by the [Malaysian R User Group (MyRUG) and R-Ladies Malaysia. This year, it is a two days virtual event consisting of workshops and presentations from many talented instructors and speakers.

## Day 1

On the first day of the conference, there was a choice to attend some R related workshops or talks prepared by R-Ladies Malaysia. For me, I had decided to attend the talks and to learn something new.

### Application of R and Shiny in Digital Marketing Intelligence

In short, digital marketing intelligence is the process of analysing information that is relevant for the business, to understand how the business is doing and help decision makers make wise choices.

Sailalith Sarupuri shared how R and Shiny were incorporated in his digital marketing intelligence architecture. Here is a summary of some useful R packages shared.

With a few lines of code, R package `httr` can be used to facilitate authentication using OAuth2 to ensure the data are imported, using REST API endpoints, by the right users.

R packages `shinycssloaders` and `shinydashboard` provides additional widgets for users to quickly create a user interface for the Shiny application. Custom components can be added using HTML, CSS and JS. 

Reactivity in Shiny applications can be hard to understand, making it hard to debug should an issue occur. R package `reactlog` is able to display an interactive reactivity workflow to help users see which reactive elements are responsible in causing the issue.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/custom-auth) lightweight javascript library can be used in a Shiny application for users to create a customised user authentication system such as registration of new users, user login, reset passwords platforms

With regards to deploying Shiny applications, there are a few options such as shinyapps.io and [Shiny Server](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server). However, there are limitations in both options when it comes to scaling. Applications deployed in shinyapps.io has a 8GB memory limited while maintainance of [Shiny Server](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server) can be laborious. The speaker shared that one solution which is to convert the Shiny application into a containerized application using Docker and then use Kubernetes to deploy, scale and manage the containerized application automatically.

It is useful create functions that can be resued in the Shiny application. Such function are called `Shiny Modules`. Sailalith gave an example of creating a `Shiny Modules` that generate dynamic report cards.

As R is a single threaded program, it can only perform one task at a time which can affect the performance of the Shiny application. It is possible to enable asynchronous programming in R using the R package `promise`. This is to ensure that the Shiny application can still response to other user interaction events while it is running a time consuming task. 

Caching or storing a temporary copy of a processed data or chart can help to speed up the running process as well. When the Shiny application refreshes or restarts, the temporary copy will only be recomputed only when the inputs have changed.

Overall, it is a very informative presentation which I will keep watching time after time.

### Data Storytelling in R 

After a content heavy presentation, the following one by Dr. Calyn Tan was thankfully less technical. The speaker shared her R experience when she first learn how to create dashboard using R in 2020. With some guidance and training from her mentors, she is now more confidence in presenting her analysis results using Shiny dashboards to a wide range of audiences. In this presentation, she shared some guidelines on how to present data more effectively using an example to raise awareness on the financial abuse and exploitation of the elderly living in rural Malaysia.

Here are some summarised key points from her talk.

-   It is wise to spend some time to understand the data.
-   Use appropriate keywords if audience comes from a specialised background.
-   Present in simple English or native language if audience comes from a different background.
-   Narrative should bridge the relationship between the analysed data and the domain knowledge or audience interest
-   Interactive dashboard can be useful to build additional data insights but it must not deviate from the dashboard's content main points.
-   Sometimes, a simple but clear dashboard is good enough for a general audience.
-   If the audience is not familiar with the presentation topic, start out first with a brief summary with useful pictures to introduce the topic and get the audience's attention. 
-   Use contrasting colours to emphasise the main points.

Calyn concluded her presentation with a few advises when learning R

-   R is not just for programming experts.
-   Success is the sum of small efforts done day in and day out.
-   Try to challenge your limits with motivation ans passion.
-   Don't be afraid to fail. Just keep trying

### Contributing to R Packages

R package contributions may be seen as a daunting task for many, especially if it is widely used and have well known maintainers. It can also be a time consuming process. However, Dr. Nurul Ain Toha emphasised that the benefits of contributing to an R package are numerous and it is worth to have the courage to give it a shot.

The talk began with a friendly introduction about R, RStudio and R packages followed by the advantages of creating an R package instead of keeping R scripts of many functions

-    Improve source code organisation.
-    Encourage good documentation.
-    Ensure code reusability and accessibility.

and the benefits of contributing to an R package

-    Improve the R package that you are using
-    Gain new R programming coding knowledge and skills
-    A chance to work with new people and expand your network and visibility in the R community

The main body of the talk are some guidelines to make a decent contribution using the speaker's experiences when contributing to the R packages `mlr3proba` and `distr6` as examples. Here is a quick preview of the main points discussed.

-    Ensure your contribution aligns with the objective of the R package.
-    Contributing to R packages is not limited to contributing code. Here are some alternative ways to contribute.
        -   Raise a question
        -   Bug reporting
        -   Improve documentation or vignette.
        -   Proposed a new idea or feature request
-    When contributing code, try to understand the design of the package
        -   Basic file structure of an R package.
        -   Does it use functional programming or object oriented programming like S3, S4, Reference Classes (RC), R6 or R7.
-   Remember to write unit test and documentation if you are creating a new function for the R package.

### Univariate Bayesian Approach to Fine-mapping Genes

The next speaker is by Dr. Hannuun Yaacob, giving a presentation on her PhD project on genetic fine-mapping. Here is a short background for those who are unfamiliar with this topic.

Genome-Wide Association Studies or GWAS for short is a research field that identify genomic variants or causal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that are associated with a risk for a disease or a particular trait. The process usually involves taking the genomic sequence of large numbers of individuals and look for regions with SNPs that occurs more frequently in those with a particular trait than the controls. However, many of these frequently occurring SNPs in the region are usually not the causal SNPs but rather have an indirect relationship with the causal SNPs. 

Fine-mapping analysis aims to find out which frequently occurring SNPs are truly causal in the region. However, this task is tricky because these frequently occurring SNPs are usually high in numbers and are correlated with each other. Thus, a brute force approach is impractical. Bayesian fine mapping approach tries to assign reliable probability that a candidate SNP is causal given the GWAS results.

Additional resources can be found in this YouTube video.

A common prior used in Bayesian fine-mapping studies is the Normal distribution. Dr. Hannuun Yaacob proposed that changing the prior to a Laplace distribution provides a more accurate calculation of the probability that a candidate SNP is causal using simulated genotype data (Hapgen2) as an example.

The second part of the presentation is a short code demonstration on how to use R to change haplotype data to genotype data.
