abstract = {This paper considers the analysis of a repeat event outcome in clinical trials of chronic diseases in the context of dependent censoring (e.g. mortality). It has particular application in the context of recurrent heart failure hospitalisations in trials of heart failure. Semi-parametric joint frailty models (JFMs) simultaneously analyse recurrent heart failure hospitalisations and time to cardiovascular death, estimating distinct hazard ratios whilst individual-specific latent variables induce associations between the two processes. A simulation study was carried out to assess the suitability of the JFM versus marginal analyses of recurrent events and cardiovascular death using standard methods. Hazard ratios were consistently overestimated when marginal models were used, whilst the JFM produced good, well-estimated results. An application to the Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity programme was considered. The JFM gave unbiased estimates of treatment effects in the presence of dependent censoring. We advocate the use of the JFM for future trials that consider recurrent events as the primary outcome. © 2016 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

    abstract = "{The counting process with the Cox-type intensity function has been commonly used to analyse recurrent event data. This model essentially assumes that the underlying counting process is a time-transformed Poisson process and that the covariates have multiplicative effects on the mean and rate function of the counting process. Recently, Pepe and Cai, and Lawless and co-workers have proposed semiparametric procedures for making inferences about the mean and rate function of the counting process without the Poisson-type assumption. In this paper, we provide a rigorous justification of such robust procedures through modern empirical process theory. Furthermore, we present an approach to constructing simultaneous confidence bands for the mean function and describe a class of graphical and numerical techniques for checking the adequacy of the fitted mean–rate model. The advantages of the robust procedures are demonstrated through simulation studies. An illustration with multiple-infection data taken from a clinical study on chronic granulomatous disease is also provided.}",

    abstract = "{In the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) trial, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of time to first worsening heart failure (HF) event or cardiovascular death in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (EF).To evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on total (ie, first and recurrent) HF events and cardiovascular death in this population.In this prespecified analysis of the DELIVER trial, the proportional rates approach of Lin, Wei, Yang, and Ying (LWYY) and a joint frailty model were used to examine the effect of dapagliflozin on total HF events and cardiovascular death. Several subgroups were examined to test for heterogeneity in the effect of dapagliflozin, including left ventricular EF. Participants were enrolled from August 2018 to December 2020, and data were analyzed from August to October 2022.Dapagliflozin, 10 mg, once daily or matching placebo.The outcome was total episodes of worsening HF (hospitalization for HF or urgent HF visit requiring intravenous HF therapies) and cardiovascular death.Of 6263 included patients, 2747 (43.9\\%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 71.7 (9.6) years. There were 1057 HF events and cardiovascular deaths in the placebo group compared with 815 in the dapagliflozin group. Patients with more HF events had features of more severe HF, such as higher N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level, worse kidney function, more prior HF hospitalizations, and longer duration of HF, although EF was similar to those with no HF events. In the LWYY model, the rate ratio for total HF events and cardiovascular death for dapagliflozin compared with placebo was 0.77 (95\\% CI, 0.67-0.89; P \\&lt; .001) compared with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95\\% CI, 0.73-0.92; P \\&lt; .001) in a traditional time to first event analysis. In the joint frailty model, the rate ratio was 0.72 (95\\% CI, 0.65-0.81; P \\&lt; .001) for total HF events and 0.87 (95\\% CI, 0.72-1.05; P = .14) for cardiovascular death. The results were similar for total HF hospitalizations (without urgent HF visits) and cardiovascular death and in all subgroups, including those defined by EF.In the DELIVER trial, dapagliflozin reduced the rate of total HF events (first and subsequent HF hospitalizations and urgent HF visits) and cardiovascular death regardless of patient characteristics, including EF.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03619213}",

The authors describe a simple, and clinically interpretable, statistical approach to this problem that is a straightforward extension of the mean survival time. }
