## Introduction

I have created this [scrollytelling](https://closeread.netlify.app/){target="_blank"} article below in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"} about my life's journey and reflection for 2025. It is best viewed on a desktop, rather than a mobile device.

Here is the link <https://jauntyjjs.github.io/reflection_2025/>{target="_blank"} to access it.
