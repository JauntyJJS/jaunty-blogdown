As diagnosis of CAD involves a costly and invasive coronary angiography procedure for patients, 
having a reliable PTP for CAD helps doctors to make better decisions during patient management. 
This ensures high risk patients can be diagnosed and treated early for CAD while avoiding unnecessary testing for low-risk patients.

R package `pretestcad` helps to ensure that these PTP values can be calculated efficiently 
as number of patient increase and pretest probability models evolved over time.

It is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pretestcad/index.html), [RUniverse](https://jauntyjjs.r-universe.dev/pretestcad) and [Github](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/pretestcad).
